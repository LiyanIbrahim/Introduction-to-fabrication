For this assignment, I was contemplating doing watermelon stands or watermelon bracelets. I really wanted to do watermelon bracelets because my theme explores watermelons as a  political symbol as a pose to just the fruit and a lot of that exists in the form of wearables and so I decided to do the bracelets. I was worried that the size would be so small and that would give me little wiggle room with the tools and also if I messed up (i was right) but I still chose to go ahead with the idea anyways. </br> 
I initially did a bunch of calculations on paper and kind of traced my order of operations. And I then transferred all that math onto the square wood. </br> 
It was kinda difficult to get my square into a perfect circle of the exact diameter I was looking for but I ended up making a hexagon and sanding the edges and it kind of worked(?). But I think the most difficult part was cutting the watermelon slices equally with the band saw and drilling the holes. I think it is hard to account for the human/machine inaccuracy when doing something so precise.
