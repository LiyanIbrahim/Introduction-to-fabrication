For this assignment, I decided to make a coaster and a coaster holder as an enclosure for the coasters. I wanted this assignment to strictly follow a non-watermelon aesthetic to reinforce my theme as a watermelon not a fruit but a symbol of resistance. So my coasters themselves narrate the story of how watermelons became the symbols of resistance in Palestine and the holder itself has the tagline “This is not a watermelon” along with an engraving of the first art piece that used watermelons as a symbol of resistance.

For the process, I started by looking up the average size of coasters which is around 3.5 inches and my acrylic thickness is ⅛ inches and so I was factoring in that thickness for the base of the box so that the walls can still fit in and it won't be too tight. And the height of the walls would be (⅛*4) because of the 4 coasters but i also wanted to add more room so it doesn't look too short and weird.

I had to reprint some of the walls because I messed up some of my calculations and I also made the edge too thin which looked ugly so I remade it.
