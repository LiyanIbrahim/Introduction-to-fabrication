Concept: </br>
For this week's assignment, I was really interested in working with fabrics and engraving with the laser cutting machines. I saw this exhibition earlier this week on how objects and materials can be witnesses. So I decided to print on fabric. My design is just sticking to the theme of a cut up watermelon but with the tag “this is not a watermelon” because I wanted to remove the association with my project that it is neutral or it’s just my obsession with watermelon as a fruit but also because i want to stick some of it on a canvas and the repetitiveness of the phrase I think could be very effective.   </br></br>  
Execussion: </br>
I initially started small by printing my design on cut up fabric that I bought to see how it would look. There was no fabric setting on the paper so Toby (shop staff) and I kind of made an informed guess of what he thought could work. I ended up printing maybe 6 of the small designs of different sizes on cut up fabric. For my large design, I printed it on a t-shirt but mainly because I didn’t know what else to do. I really liked the idea of getting a canvas and sticking my small designs on it repetitively and overlapping and I think I might cut up the large t-shirt design as my base.  </br>
