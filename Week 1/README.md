For this weeks box assignment, I decided to make something that I can potentially add to my final collection of objects. My theme is watermelon and while I was doing research on different usages of watermelons across the world, culturally, practically, politically or otherwise, I came across how watermelons are grown in japan. “They're regular melons that were placed inside boxes while growing. The resulting shape makes the fruit easier to transport, cut, and store”. 
And so I wanted to make a watermelon square box that resembles it. </br>

I used some scrap wood and it isn't thick enough to cut vertically to get the lid like how we did in class and so I used another piece of the same wood and it was kind of challenging trying to get both of them to the same size. Rounding the edges while maintaining the size of the box was also another challenge so I ended up hand filing the edges to try to navigate that
